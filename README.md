# Problem Based Learning
## Data Structures and Algorithms
In PBL given as semester project to me i had to work on dataset of India Agriculture Crop Production which provides information about crop production in India across different states, districts, and seasons.
I used Data Structures such as LinkedList, Stack Queue and Array.
This project was a great source of learning for me.
I implemented several Algorithms to solve various problems in it which also enhanced my problem solving skills.
